SNHU CS255 Final Submission
* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client for the DriverPass project was a small company called DriverPass.   They were looking to design a system to help take advantage of a gap in the market when    it comes to training students for their driving exams.  They noticed that 65% of students fail their first attempt and are looking to provide a service to increase     pass rates through accurate online training and in-person road time.  To provide this service they're looking to create an application to manage the online training      and in-person scheduling of road time.

* What did you do particularly well?
  I feel as though I did particularly well on translating the stated needs of the client into the requirements for the system.   This is a critical step in the process     as any requirements missed here won't be included in the final deliverable or will require re-work to add in later.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would go back and add some additional complexity to the UML Diagrams.  I feel as though they could use some additional complexity to more fully represent the systems   being implemented.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The information we have is what the client gave us, but as software engineering professionals we have to take that one step further.  The client knows what they want     but doesn't understand the software development process.   Marrying what we know with what the customer states they want is the secret sauce in this step.   Ensuring     we have the functional, non-functional, and technical requirements is the work of this phase.   Without getting an accurate accounting of everything going into the       system, we may have extensive re-writes or re-engineering later on.   And if the experience is not what they were looking for, customers may go elsewhere.

* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I would leverage many of the techniques learned in this class for analyzing and evaluating the design of future software.   Starting with the requirements gathering     phase, interviewing the customer and asking the important questions.   Next, moving to the documentation phase where I would document all of the functional, non-         functional, and technical requirements in a design document.   Moving on to completing the various UML diagrams, process, flow, and object to visually represent the     way the system will work.   After getting buy-in from the client, starting the work of building the systems and programming the various modules needed for the software.
